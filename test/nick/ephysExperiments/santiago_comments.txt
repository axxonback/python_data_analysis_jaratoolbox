* loadopenephys.py
- The goal is to load raw data from a file (in raw format?)
- Should it have a way to add cluster data?
- Should it also convert numbers to the right units? (timestamps to seconds, divide gain, etc)

* ephyscore.py
- The goal is to load data easily given a cell from the database.
- It may make it inefficient to load several clusters/cells from the same tetrode.
  (since it requires reloading the tetrode spike data)
- It should associate to ephys events (sent from arduino) and to relevant behavioral data (stored by taskontrol).

* recordingday.py
- recordingday imports ephys_experiment_v3.EphysExperiment
  but when using them we also need to import both?
  Somethign seems recursive. They should be independent or hierarchical.
- Parameters laserPulseResponse,soundResponsive,followsTrain don't seem appropriate
  because they will probably change in the future (some added, some gone).
  Maybe we should have them in a dictionary of 'features'.

* ephys_experiment_v3.py
- This object should be independent of the server. Maybe we need to define better the role of this object.

= Minor:
- Name 'recordingday.Recording' may be misleading (there are many recordings per day), 
  but I can't come up with a better one.
