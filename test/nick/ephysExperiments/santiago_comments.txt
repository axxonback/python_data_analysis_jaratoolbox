* recordingday.py
- recordingday imports ephys_experiment_v3.EphysExperiment
  but when using them we also need to import both?
  Somethign seems recursive. They should be independent or hierarchical.
- Parameters laserPulseResponse,soundResponsive,followsTrain don't seem appropriate
  because they will probably change in the future (some added, some gone).
  Maybe we should have them in a dictionary of 'features'.

* ephys_experiment_v3.py
- This object should be independent of the server. Maybe we need to define better the role of this object.

= Minor:
- Name 'recordingday.Recording' may be misleading (there are many recordings per day), 
  but I can't come up with a better one.
